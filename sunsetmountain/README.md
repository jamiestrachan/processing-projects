I'm trying to create a kind of [synthwave-style sunset image](https://www.google.com/search?q=synthwave+sunset+mountain+grid+wallpaper&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwj7mObOou-BAxU4HGIAHTsiBBQQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=synthwave+sunset+mountain+grid+wallpaper&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzoECCMQJ1CABViqEGCjEWgAcAB4AIABYIgBsgaSAQIxMZgBAKABAaoBC2d3cy13aXotaW1nwAEB&sclient=img&ei=GUAnZbuoMLi4iLMPu8SQoAE&bih=1270&biw=1406) as a generative art project.

The contours of the "mountain" build up with some amount of randomness so it's different on each draw. I'm playing around with different ways of introducing variance to see what I like best.

So far, it looks like this:
